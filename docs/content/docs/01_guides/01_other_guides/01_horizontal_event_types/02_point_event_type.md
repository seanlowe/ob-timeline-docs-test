Let's change our existing event to be of type `point`. We only need to add the param `data-type` and give it value: `point`.

It should look like this:

```html
<div class="ob-timelines"
  data-title="Our First Event"
  data-start-date="2024-5-24"
  data-type="point"
>
  Event Number One
</div>
```

and when we look at our timeline, we'll see it looks different than before.
