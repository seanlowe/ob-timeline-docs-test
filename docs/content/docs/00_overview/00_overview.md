This is an updated fork of Darakah's famous [obsidian-timelines](https://www.github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines) plugin for the [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) notes app. Based on what I've seen, there were numerous reports of bugs in the code, documentation was either lacking or frankly just confusing and it's been overall worked on irregularly. This fork, **Timelines (Revamped)**, aims to fix some of those problems.

But, credit should be placed where credit is due. Kudos to [Darakah](https://github.com/Darakah) for his amazing work on the original version of this plugin. I've learned a lot just combing through the code as I was doing my refactors.

Also kudos to everyone who contributed to the original plugin, especially:
- [Erin Schnabel](https://github.com/ebullient),
- [ReconVirus](https://github.com/ReconVirus),
- [Ethan Miller](https://github.com/ethanimproving), and
- [Travis Mosley](https://github.com/tlm2021)

<br>

For those coming from Darakah's original plugin, *things have diverged* and do not work the same way.

Please take the time to read all the way through. Thanks!
